## Inspiration

Some project that served as inspiration for SpinPlots are:

- Quantum Accelerators [Python package template](https://github.com/Quantum-Accelerators/template) created by [Andrew S. Rosen](https://github.com/Andrew-S-Rosen)
  
- [NMRglue](https://github.com/jjhelmus/nmrglue) by [Jonathan J. Helmus](https://github.com/jjhelmus) for providing Python function for reading, processing NMR data

- My own frustration trying to remember NMRglue's syntax ðŸ¤ª.
